        <p>In a time where travel bloggers and international travelers flood our social media feeds with incredible tales of their holidays, you can’t help but wonder just <strong>what is the most visited country in the world.</strong> Which stunning scenery do we need to see? Where do we pin on the world map next? What are the top travel destinations?</p>
        <p>The tourism industry has had rollercoaster years between 2020 and 2022. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic taking its toll on the sector, international tourism was able to recover 63% of pre-pandemic levels.</p>
        <p>According to the World Tourism Organization’s publication “<a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/abs/10.18111/wtobarometereng.2023.21.1.1" target="_blank">World Tourism Barometer</a>“, <b>a total of 917 million international tourists traveled the world in 2022</b>, aspiring adventurers and globetrotters have proven themselves to be resilient and resourceful. The subsequent pent-up demand, coupled with an easing of travel restrictions, led to a <b>102% increase in the international tourism compared to 2021.</b></p>
        <p>While not yet achieving pre-pandemic levels, this is considered a notable recovery and one which bodes well for 2023 as it sets out to consolidate its comeback.</p>
        <span>It’s time to grab your passport and explore the world again!</span>
        <p>Here are the 10 most visited countries in the world, according to the last issue of the UNWTO World Tourism Barometer – January 2023

        <p>By subregions, Western Europe (87%) and the Caribbean (84%) came closest to their pre-pandemic levels.</p>
        <p>The recovery was uneven across regions, with Europe and the Middle East outperforming the other regions due to their more successful implementation of coordinated travel measures. <b>The recovery is expected to consolidate in 2023</b>, with pent-up demand particularly in Asia and the Pacific, as destinations and markets open up.</p>
